    "# Python program to walk directories and copy files of interest to a common directory\n",

    "### Background: \n",
    "    Recently my wife purchased a download of embroidery files for her BabyLock embroidery machine.\n",
    "    The files were downloaded as several Zip files separated by alphabetic devisions (A-C.zip, D-G.zip, etc.)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Inside of each top level Zip files were combinations of directories, other zip files and, possibly the particular\n",
    "    files suitable for her machin (.PES).  However, along with the .PES files were the equivalent number of other\n",
    "    file extensions that were for 7 or 8 other embroidery machine brands and, hence were not needed or wanted.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    I devised this program to recursively call functions to walk from the top level of zip files down each sub-level to the \n",
    "    very bottom of the tree extracting only the .PES files and putting them in a new top level directory (PESFiles).\n",
    "    Each Zip file name was used to create a directory to store the appropriate files to pertinent groups...if the\n",
    "    zip file was named cuteBunnies.zip, a directory named cuteBunnies was created to accept the embedded files for\n",
    "    that zip.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This top level file should wind up in the c:\\users\\yourname\\ location on a Windows machine.  Have not tried on my Mac.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    I then copied the new top level directory and all included files of interest to a DVD for transfer to her PC and to\n",
    "    allow archiveing for her sanity.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Process\n",
    "1. Download Anaconda (if not installed already.) Python 3 is required.\n",
    "1. Copy this file to a known location (e.g. Desktop)\n",
    "1. open Jupyter Notebook and open this file.\n",
    "1. Change the occurances of PES to the file extension of interest...\n",
    "    or add fnmatches for directories, filenames or extensions as desired for your purpose.\n",
    "1. IMPORTANT! For testing, uncomment the print statements and comment the \"handle\" statements to \n",
    "    verify that it is working.  This will show what is going to happen without actually writting anything\n",
    "    to your harddrive.  If staisfied, turn the \"handle\" statements back on.\n",
    "1. Run the cell below and watch the magic in your file explorer.\n",
